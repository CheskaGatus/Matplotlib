Data Analysis on Pyber - A Fictional Ride Sharing Company

Pyber's complete recordset of rides contains information about every active driver and historic ride. Details include city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Objectives: 

A) Build a bubble plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

B) Build three pie charts:
* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

C) Use Pandas library, Matplotlib library and Jupyter Notebook.
